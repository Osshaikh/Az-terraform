# Terraform Azure Deployment Example

## Overview

This project showcases the power of infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform with a modular approach to deploy Azure services, seamlessly integrated with GitHub Actions for automation. Leveraging Terraform allows for scalable, reproducible, and manageable infrastructure provisioning, while the modular approach enhances reusability, simplifies maintenance, and allows for independent versioning of modules. GitHub Actions further automate the deployment process, enabling continuous integration and delivery with minimal manual intervention.

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Easily scale your infrastructure up or down based on requirements, with changes tracked through version control.
- **Reusability**: Modular Terraform configurations mean components can be reused across different environments or projects, speeding up deployment and ensuring consistency.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions automate the provisioning and teardown of resources, reducing the potential for human error and increasing efficiency.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are versioned and can be reviewed as part of code review processes, improving auditability and traceability.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can collaborate more effectively on infrastructure changes, with clear documentation and review processes facilitated by GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites met:
- An Azure account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- A GitHub account for managing the project and workflows.
- Terraform installed locally for testing and development purposes.
- Basic understanding of Terraform, Azure, and GitHub Actions.

## Setup

1. **Fork or clone the repository**: Start by forking this repository or cloning it to your local machine.
2. **Configure Azure credentials**: Set up your Azure service principal and configure your GitHub repository secrets with the Azure credentials. Required secrets include `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, and `ARM_TENANT_ID`.
3. **Initialize Terraform modules**: Navigate to the Terraform configurations and initialize the modules by running:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
4. **Customize configurations**: Adjust the Terraform configurations according to your Azure environment and the services you wish to deploy.
